# The Full Weasel 🦦🎂

A birthday-themed rhythm game PWA where you help Dexter catch delicious treats and dodge sharks in sync with the music. Built with React + Vite for a buttery-smooth mobile-first experience.

## Key Features

- **Three-Round Gameplay:** Progress through increasingly challenging rounds by filling your party meter to 100%
- **Lane-Based Catching:** Swipe left/right to catch Nana's Cheese and Iced Tea as they fall
- **Shark Dodging:** Tap center to jump over horizontal sharks swimming across the screen
- **Combo System:** Build consecutive catches for a 🔥 combo multiplier badge
- **Perfect Timing Bonus:** +4 extra points for catching items at the optimal moment
- **Celebration Poses:** Dexter cycles through 5 expressive poses (joyful, excited, proud, focused, neutral) on each catch
- **Strip Phase Finale:** Rapid-tap bonus phase at the end with dramatic zoom
- **Victory Celebration:** Confetti explosion with the iconic "You can leave your hat on" payoff
- **Haptic Feedback:** Distinct vibration patterns for perfect catches, normal catches, and shark hits
- **Touch Ripples:** Visual feedback on every tap
- **Offline Support:** Service worker caches sprites for offline play (media requires network)

## Installing as a PWA on Android

The Full Weasel is designed as a Progressive Web App for the best mobile experience. Here's how to install it on your Android device:

### Method 1: Browser Prompt

2. Play for a few seconds — the browser will detect it's a PWA
3. Look for the **"Add to Home Screen"** banner at the bottom
4. Tap **Install** and confirm
5. The app icon will appear on your home screen

### Method 2: Manual Installation
1. Open the game URL in **Chrome**
2. Tap the **three-dot menu** (⋮) in the top-right corner
3. Select **"Add to Home screen"** or **"Install app"**

Once installed, the game runs in standalone mode (no browser UI), supports offline sprite caching, and feels like a native app.

## Why Dexter?

*Dexter is a small, tricolor Phalène dog with floppy ears and a perpetually unimpressed expression... ungovernable, sharp-nosed and convinced he's the quality bar. Alert, picky, dependable and devoted to doing things exactly his way: if he's staring at you, assume you've made a mistake. If he approves, it means it works.*

🎂 **Happy Birthday, you magnificent weasel!** 🎂
